GotoSQL
=======

It allows to use a Go script to define a database model and so to generate its
corresponding SQL language and Go types. It is not an ORM neither it isn't
goint to be it since an ORM creates an extra layer to the database access.

The API is based in [SQLAlchemy's][4] and here they are all [SQLAlchmey's types]
[5], althought I've only added these basic types:

+ Integer
+ Float
+ Text
+ Blob
+ Boolean

Function *Metadata* has method *Mode* to create tables related to localization.
If it's set, then at generating SQL, it creates an extra table (that starts wich
"***_***") for each model.

***NOTE:*** it is tested with SQLite3, and you have in mind that it isn't ready
to working with relations between tables since I don't need it by now.  
And when is generated the file Go, it's used "***_***" as package name so rename
it at your project's name.
